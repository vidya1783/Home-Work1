Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee().
Expected output:
   getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1L), should return 2 timesheets.
Actual output:
   getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1L), was returning 1 timesheet.
How did you fix this bug?
   Replaced if with while.


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project.
Expected output:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId(1L), should return 3 timesheets.
Actual output:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId(1L), was returning 2 timesheets.
How did you fix this bug?
    Replaced employee_id with project_id in the where clause.


Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
   updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved.
Expected output:
   Timesheet(1L), should retrieve updated timesheet.
Actual output:
   Timesheet(1L), was not returning updated timesheet.
How did you fix this bug?
   Removed employee_id = ?, project_id = ? from SET command and
   removed updatedTimesheet.getEmployeeId(), updatedTimesheet.getProjectId() from jdbc template.


Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getBillableHours_returns_correct_total().
Expected output:
    Billable hours for Employee(2L) and Project(2L) should be 0.0
Actual output:
    Returned 2.0
How did you fix this bug?
    I added an additional WHERE clause to the getBillableHours(Long employeeId, Long projectId)
    method so that it only returned the hours for items where billable hours are marked as true.
